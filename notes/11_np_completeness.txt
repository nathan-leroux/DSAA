NP-Completeness

   What is NP completeness?
   NP-Completeness is a complexity classification of problems in theoretical computer science.
   N stands for Non-deterministic, meaning it can be expressed as a function for a non-deterministic Turing machine
   P stands for polynomial time (n^x, where x is any constant integer) which is considered a fast algorithm.

   A problem is categorised as P if it can be solved and verified in polynomial time.
   A problem is categorised as NP if it can be verified in polynomial time, but not solved (currently).
   
   A problem is classified as NP-Hard if it meets the following:
      - It is at least as hard as NP problems 
      - What this means is that all NP problems can be reduced to the problem
   NP-Hard problems have a transitive property
   Meaning that if you can reduce an NP-Hard problem to a new problem, it also means the new problem is NP-Hard

   A problem is categorised as NP-Complete if it meets the following:
      - It is a decision based problem, meaning it evaluates to 'yes' or 'no'
      - It is an NP problem
      - It is an NP-Hard problem
      - All NP-Complete problems can be reduced to any other NP-Complete problems

   The Study of NP completeness is useful as if a polynomial solution is found for any NP-Complete problem, it implies all NP problems are solvable.

   For practical use, being unable to prove that a problem is NP-Hard indicates that a quick solution exists.
   NP-Completeness also allows the properties that make a problem hard to be identified.


   11.1 Problems and Reductions

      A reduction is defined as an algorithm that convert one problem into another
      If problem A is reducible to B and an efficient algorithm for B exists
      Then B's algorithm could be used as a subroutine for solving A.
      When this is true, problem A cannot be 'harder' than problem B

      By being able to reduce one problem to another, you show that fundamentally the two problems are the same, just in different contexts
      For NP-Complete problems one problem can be reduced to any other
      Essentially a polynomial solution for one would be applicable to all classified NP-Complete

      Terminology when describing reductions:
         An instance of a problem is the set of inputs for which a literal solution exists.
         A problem is the general question that describes all instances

      The simplest class of problems to work with are decision problems (yes or no)
      Most interesting decision problems can be rephrased as decision problems, NP-Complete theory is easier to apply in these cases.


   11.4 Satisfiability

      When proving problems are hard through reduction, they must be initially reduced through a certifiably hard problem
      Satisfiability is a simple logic problem that is generally agreed to be hard
      Given a set of boolean variables, a b c
      determine whether
