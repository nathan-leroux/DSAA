Weighted Graph Algorithms

   Weighted graphs exist when the value or 'weight' of each edge connecting vertices are not equal.
   Real world examples of edges being different weights include construction costs, travel time, length, etc.
   Graph techniques explained before still apply but the ones described below deal with the distinction in edge weights.


   8.1 Minimum Spanning Trees

      A 'spanning tree' is a subset of edges such that each node is connected in a tree containing no back edges. Essentially the minimum number of edges to connect all the nodes.
      A 'minimum spanning tree' is a spanning tree where the edge weights sum to the smallest possible value, given the available edges.
      It is possible for there to be multiple correct minimum spanning trees for one graph.
